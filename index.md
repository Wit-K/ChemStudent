# Electrochemical CO2 Reduction
**A practical, beginner-friendly guide for starting research**

---

## The Motivation
Transitioning from standard high school chemistry to active research presents a steep learning curve. While AP and IB curricula cover the basics of redox reactions, they rarely address the practicalities of modern electrocatalysis.

Conversely, academic literature is often written for graduate-level researchers, assuming access to advanced equipment and a deep background in thermodynamics. This leaves a gap for students who have the curiosity to explore "Artificial Photosynthesis" but lack the specific technical guidance to start.

## Who is this for?
*   **High School Researchers:** Students looking to conduct independent research projects or science fair entries.
*   **Beginners:** Anyone with a basic chemistry background attempting their first electrolysis experiments.
*   **Builders:** Students needing to construct experimental setups (H-cells, electrodes) on a limited budget.

## What you will find here
This site acts as a bridge between textbook theory and laboratory application. It focuses on the specific challenge of reducing Carbon Dioxide ($CO_2$) into useful fuels/chemicals using electricity.
