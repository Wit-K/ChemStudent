# The Science of CO2 Reduction
*Understanding how we turn air into fuel.*

---

## 1. What is Electrochemical Reduction?
At its core, **Electrochemical CO2 Reduction (ECR)** is the reverse of burning fossil fuels.
*   **Burning (Combustion):** Fuel + Oxygen $\rightarrow$ CO2 + Energy
*   **ECR (Reduction):** CO2 + Energy (Electricity) $\rightarrow$ Fuel + Oxygen

## 2. The Setup: The Electrolytic Cell
To do this, we need an electrochemical cell consisting of three main parts:
1.  **Cathode (-):** Where CO2 is reduced (gains electrons).
2.  **Anode (+):** Where water is oxidized (loses electrons).
3.  **Electrolyte:** The liquid that allows ions to move between them.

## 3. The Chemistry
The magic happens at the catalyst surface. Here are the half-reactions we are trying to achieve:

**At the Cathode (Reduction):**
$$ CO_2 + 2H^+ + 2e^- \rightarrow CO + H_2O $$
*(This produces Carbon Monoxide, a precursor to fuels)*

**At the Anode (Oxidation):**
$$ 2H_2O \rightarrow O_2 + 4H^+ + 4e^- $$

## 4. The Challenge: Competition
The biggest problem you will face in the lab is the **Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER)**. Water *also* wants to break down into hydrogen gas:
$$ 2H^+ + 2e^- \rightarrow H_2 $$
*Your goal as a researcher is to suppress this hydrogen reaction and favor the CO2 reaction.*
